# What to fix before 1.0

- The choice parameters have repeated files. sb-dynamic-paramenter-plugin stores them 
in a commons directory. Probably it's a good idea.

- We could do with some constants too, to avoid repeating the parameter types.

- Common parent descriptors for some parameter definitions, like scriptler.

- Enough test coverage

- Duplicate code in scriptler classes and normal classes

- Duplicate code in Javascript cascade.js

- The classes are overly complicated. We copied the class model from sb-dynamic-parameter plugin, but it could be simpler

- Move getScriptResultAsList and similar "script-ish" methods to the ScriptParameterDefinition. ATM they are in the BaseParameterDefinition
